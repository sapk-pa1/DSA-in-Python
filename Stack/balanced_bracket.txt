Iteration through String Characters:
- The algorithm traverses each character in the given string.

Handling Opening Brackets:
- When an opening bracket is encountered, it is pushed onto the stack.

Processing Closing Brackets:
- If a closing bracket is encountered:
- An element is popped from the stack.
- The popped element is matched with the closing bracket.

Checking for Match:
- If the popped element is an opening bracket of the same type, the brackets are considered matched.
- If not, the set of brackets is deemed unbalanced.

Empty Stack for Balanced Example:
- At the end of the iteration, if the stack is empty, it indicates a balanced set of brackets.
- Remaining Elements in Stack for Unbalanced Example:

If the stack still contains elements after iteration, the brackets are unbalanced.
